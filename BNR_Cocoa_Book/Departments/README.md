Departments
===========

A simple app that maintains a databse of company departments and employees.

It uses an SQLite database for data storage. It demonstrates switching between to two different child view controllers via a drop down menu, using drop down menus in table columns to select items from a list, and editing of table columns. It also demonstrates animating the size of the window when switching to the different view controllers.
