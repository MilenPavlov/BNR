Carlot
======

An NSDocument project that uses a NSTableView to select, display, edit, and enter cars into a car "database" using an NSArrayController.

It demonstrates file loading and saving capabilities, but it does not actually use a database. It also implements undo, redo, dragging an image in and storing it with the data, table column editing, resizing, moving, sorting, and displaying details when a row is selected.
