    <!--- couldn't get to work. Nothing seems to set the state to activated, 
    although this resource is assigned and works if state_activated is false, 
    nothing happens when selecting items to delete with state_activated set to true -->
     <item
        android:state_activated="true"
        android:drawable="@android:color/darker_gray" ></item>
      
</selector>
